## (Micro) Animations
_by Andi_

Example of what is meant: [Josh W. Comeau's website](https://www.joshwcomeau.com/css/interactive-guide-to-flexbox/)

1. What libraries do we use?

- CSS animations
- Greensock

2. Who is responsible for saying what is to be done?

- UX department

3. What's the use case?

- Brand identity or user experience
- Gamification

There is View Transitions API / page transitions coming up. 

What's more efficient: Changing CSS variables with JS or completely doing it in JS?

Manually crafting animations is rewarding.
