# how not to be a terrible manager

Tl;dr

- Use common sense
- Reflect regularly on what is and isn't going well
- Enable your team members to do their best work

All the rules:

## No micromanagement

E.g. don't force people to follow certain linter rules,
rather create those together as a team!

## Have a vision

What motivates people to work here?

## Have one-on-ones

Not everyone wants to talk about their problems in a big group.
Ask people in one-on-ones if theres anything you can help them with.

E.g. have a one-on-one with everyone every two weeks
-> This works well in small companies.

There can also be one-on-ones between engineers.

Be aware: Sometimes what people say they need and what they actually need
are two different things.

## Have retros and reviews

Get everyone at the table:

- Get ideas: Someone who works on A might have a good idea for B
- Share the vision: Remind everyone of the big picture

## Don't have silos

If a single person works on something, what happens if they leave?

## If your company grows: Know early enough when you need more managers

Good managers are not easy to find!

## Have tech talks

Allow engineers to present something they've made
-> This fosters motivation and knowledge transfer.

## Think about your onboarding process

What does *everyone* have to know?

## Be the first to take criticism

Don't pass stress on to your subordinates.

Also: don't overwork people.

## Deal with deadlines

- If deadlines are regularly too tight, escalate to upper management
- Often missing deadlines is better than alienating your team

## See something, say something

If someone on your team is showing poor performance, talk to them about it.

Also: Make sure everyone on your team has a way to escalate problems to you.

## Review your processes

Regularly look at processes and find things to simplify.

And communicate that openly to your team!

## Know your team members

Everyone is different. Know everyones strengths, weaknesses and values.

Juniors might need more micromanagement, seniors might benefit from more autonomy. 

## If you tell someone what to do, also tell them why

Also: encourage people to question your decisions.

## Be motivated

Nobody wants to work for a manager who doesn't want to work themselves.

But also: Work isn't everything. Show your team members what a reasonable work-life-balance looks like.

## Give good feedback

Good feedback is a skill that can be trained.

- Be honest
- Be authentic

## Give your best team members more responsibility

But not more work!

## Lead by example

Your team members *will* emulate what you do. Don't act in ways you don't want your team to copy.
