# JSCraftCamp 2023 - Session notes

We like to collect session notes for all sessions if possible. If you have slides for your session or took notes - please share them with all of us!

_This repository will be filled later, as soon as the JSCC starts._

Create a directory for the session, add a `README.md` into it and add a link to it in the table below. 

Thank you for your support!
